I'm a software engineer at The Trade Desk.

I'm interested in programming language development and theory, and spend the majority of my free time developing [Steel](https://github.com/mattwparas/steel),
an embedded scheme in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) inspired by [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)

Eventually my goal is for all software I use to be custom Steel implementations, including this site.
