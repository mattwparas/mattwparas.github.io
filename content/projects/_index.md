<!-- I'm a software engineer at The Trade Desk, working on ML ops and improving development practices

I'm interested in programming language development and theory, and spend the majority of my free time developing [Steel](https://github.com/mattwparas/steel),
an embedded scheme in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) inspired by [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)

Eventually my goal is for all software I use to be custom Steel implementations, including this site -->
